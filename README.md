# Palivizumab

## Background
Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody which can prevent infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Due to its high cost, it is recommended for high-risk infants only. Eligibility criteria in the UK are listed in 27a of the Green Book:  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/458469/Green_Book_Chapter_27a_v2_0W.PDF

## Project aims:
We developed a cohort of children eligible for palivizumab (according to the criteria from the Green Book) to describe access to palivizumab in eligible children in England. More details on cohort derivation and validation will be published in:

## Data:
We used the Hospital Treatment Insights (HTI) database, which links pharmacy dispensing records for 43/152 hospitals in England and patientâ€™s hospital records from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). HTI is maintained by IQVIA (https://www.iqvia.com/).
